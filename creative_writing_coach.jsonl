{"prompt": "**Empty Inside**\n\nKate struggled with the antiquated padlock to the factory. The key fit, but after decades of disuse the mechanism refused to budge. As she shifted her hand, looking for a better grip on the lock, the rust caught the web of her thumb and tore at the skin.\n\n\"Hell!\" She jerked away, and tried and failed to find a painless way to hold her hand. \"Worst *fricking* place for a cut,\" Kate mumbled. She'd wondered where she was going to go after this trip, and now she knew. Straight to a clinic for a tetanus booster. She eyed the padlock and considered abandoning her inheritance entirely. It wasn't like there was going to be anything valuable inside. But she'd come all the way to Detroit now, and that combined with her curiosity to make her try one more time. \n\nShe began to reach for the lock but pulled away when she saw the tiny drop of blood amidst the rust. Touching only the key, she gave it a twist to the right. This time, it turned easily, and the chain slithered out of the door handles when she lifted the lock. The rattle of the links striking the asphalt echoed between the decaying buildings, and dropping the lock provided a staccato punctuation.\n\nThe doors to the factory opened with a thunderous creak, to the chittered complaints of waking bats. Decades of shifting foundations had apparently made the doors a little bit load-bearing, and Kate winced as cracks spiderwebbed across one of the few surviving windows when she stepped inside. The evening sun and the high-set windows combined to leave the shop floor covered in shadows. Darkness loomed over everything, only the vaguest shapes visible in the gloom.\n\nKate fumbled with her phone for a flashlight as faint noises rustled in the blackness, some irrational fear crawling down her spine and finding a serious house on serious earth in her belly. *Something dwelled there*.\n\nShe released a slightly hysterical giggle when the cone of illumination revealed only a black cat, retreating to its home in the empty engine bay of a half-finished car. Sweeping her light around revealed a glimpse into history, and she was suddenly glad she'd come.\n\nGravity had done its slow work over the years, and puddles of grease lay beneath the machinery, never to be replaced. Cars in various states of manufacture and decay littered the floor. Between the broken windows of the factory and the vehicles, every one of Kate's steps was accompanied by the crunch of glass. \n\nThere were no straight lines between the workspaces, and Kate soon lost track of the entrance as she wound her way through the factory, taking pictures of the most interesting unique scenes of abandonment and dyspathy. She still jerked at unexpected sounds, and listened carefully for any that might be dangerous, even if she knew it was silly as she did so. But between her excitement and fear, she failed to keep track of her declining battery.\n\nStrangely, there was no noise the doors swung shut on their own.\n\nShe was too far away too hear when the chains crept back through the handles, and when the lock, the single drop of blood vanished, clicked itself shut.\n\nWhen the newly cracked window shattered, there was no one left to hear it.\n\nWC: 553\n\nr/NobodysGaggle\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening of your story is very strong, I like the way you set the scene and introduce the protagonist. The description of the factory is also very evocative and creates a strong sense of place. However, there are a few small things you could do to improve your style. For example, you could use more concrete images and sensory detail to bring the reader into the story. For example, you could describe the sound of the padlock rattling, or the smell of rust and grease in the factory.\n\nYou have done a great job of creating a sense of tension and foreboding in the story. However, there are a few places where you could be more concise. For example, you could cut some of the dialogue in the second paragraph, or focus on one or two senses in the description of the factory.\n\nThe ending of the story is very strong and leaves the reader with a sense of unease."}
{"prompt": "\"A girl's trip\", a trip to remember--that was an understatement.\n\nStill on the high of graduating together with masters from Georgetown, best friends since preschool Cara and Ginger agreed a week-long road trip back home to Tacoma would make a welcome reward. Silently each considered it would be their last together before life took them down very different paths: Cara had a wedding to plan; Ginger would come back up from California and the job she would be starting to serve as maid of honor.\n\nDay three: destination in their GPS and let it ride, trading off driving duties. Ginger was comfortable in big cities; Cara preferred the long, lonesome stretches. The drive was relaxed; neither in a hurry for this trip to end. Ginger was moving her outstretched hand out the window in Nebraska when the music was interrupted.\n\n\"...a multi-vehicle accident in central Nebraska has both directions of I-80 backed up for fifty miles. With the forecast of high daytime temperatures with severe storms and probable tornadoes mid-afternoon officials have started running buses to evacuate stranded motorists to safety. You are advised to avoid I-80 or exit as soon as possible. Repeating...\"\n\n\"Cara, look,\" Ginger said, pointing.\n\nCara pulled them off the interstate to a small, unmaintained gravel road. Their trusty GPS seemed stuck recalculating as they followed the barely-there road slowly, the sound of heavy weeds brushing the car's underside. It seemed like hours when they rounded a corner, suddenly before an antiquated, collapsing house atop a hill.\n\n\"Whoa, a serious house on serious earth,\" Cara whispered. She stopped the car, the two girls getting out to look over a dilapidated town spread before them.\n\n\"'Welcome to Lauralton',\" Ginger read. \"Probably a company town. House probably the owners. See, there's the factory,\" she said, pointing to the far side of town. Building after building showed signs of the decay and neglect of dyspathy, many of them heaps overtaken by weeds. The burnt-out walls of the factory cast long shadows as they approached. As they drove into the shadow the car coughed once, rolling to a stop at the factory entrance.\n\n\"Dammit,\" Cara blurted, hammering the wheel.\n\n\"'S okay. Pop the hood.\" Ginger said, getting out to take a look. \n\n\"How bad?\" Cara asked, joining her as Ginger looked carefully. Ginger shook her head.\n\n\"Damn, no signal,\" Cara said.\n\n\"Me either.\" Ginger looked at the factory building's external stairs. \"Up there?\"\n\n\"On it,\" Cara replied, racing through weeds to the nearest building's stairs. At the top she checked again.\n\n\"Well?\" Ginger yelled up.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nGinger looked at the approaching clouds. \"We need cover before that storm gets here,\" she said.\n\nThe doors opened easily, the girls cautiously entering. They walked past several offices to look onto a factory floor, covered by a collapsed roof.\n\n\"What's that?\" Ginger asked, pointing at a dirty, faded but still visible mural on the far wall.\n\n\"Wow... an \"E\" Award,\" Cara whispered in awe.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"An excellence award, given for production in WWII. My great-grandma worked in a plant like this, when Grandma was an infant. Died several days after an accident there, Grandma said.\"\n\nGinger shivered, feeling the temperature drop, the wind picking up. \"I need to pee...\"\n\n\"You go that way. If you find a bathroom, yell.\" Cara said.\n\nGinger walked into a hallway past several doors, looking inside. Her scream brought Cara running.\n\n\"What?!?\"\n\n\"There's someone in there\" Ginger said, shaking.\n\nCara carefully inched the door open, looking at a dirty mirror in the light of a small window. \"No one there. I can stand guard if you still need to pee.\"\n\n\"Nope, 'M good.\" Ginger snapped.\n\n\"I saw a display when you screamed I want to go back to.\"\n\nTogether the girls went back to the display, a large, fading group photo the centerpiece.\n\n\"Lauralton Aviation. Why does that sound familiar?\" Cara pondered.\n\n\"Cara, I don't like this place.\" Ginger said, squinting at the picture. \"Hey, that could be you,\" she said, pointing. \"Let's get out of here.\"\n\n\"Go see if it'll crank now--here's the keys. I'll be right out--give me ten more minutes to look around. Hit the horn if I'm not out,\" Cara said as she looked closer at the picture. \n\nCara heard Ginger racing down the steps. \"Great-grandm...?\" she asked rhetorically. Turning around she looked into the same eyes that peered up from the photo, her mirror image. She blinked, now nothing in front of her but disturbed dust.\n\n-----\n\nDarkness loomed over everything. As the car roared to life Cara jumped into the passenger's seat, out of breath. \"Go, go, go!\" she yelled, slapping the dashboard.\n\nHeadlights on, Ginger floored it for the approaching storm, their dust drifting toward the factory.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Something... something dwells there,\" Cara mumbled, wrapping her arms close.\n\n\n-----\n\n(Word count: 800.

However, the story quickly loses momentum in the middle and becomes quite confusing. I'm not quite sure what is going on with the factory or the town, and the ending is very abrupt.\n\nThere are also a few technical issues with the writing. For example, you use the word \"dyspathy\" which is not a real word. You also have several typos throughout the story.

{"prompt": "#Genreic Shift\n\nPart 4\n\nGenrene had just managed to climb a tree before a figure stumbled out of the shadows. Cyrus hobbled towards the statue and promptly fell to his knees before it. He was covered in blood, more than Genrene knew that could come from only two men. No, another cluster of his once-loyal men had chased him too. Where were they now? Likely dead at his first mate\u2019s hands.\n\nGenrene\u2019s thoughts quickly went blank though and his eyes widened as the spectacle of the statue before him turned. Turned? No, as it corrupted. Sure, it became a rusted brown first, as if it were a giant slab of iron left out in the rain for centuries, but as he watched, the land around him turned too.\n\n\u201cMy servant,\u201d the entity rumbled. \u201cRise Cyrus, for there is work to be done. This isle you stand upon is one a part of the forgotten lands. Of antiquated civilisations made from metals long lost to decay. Now, my child of doom, you shall be used as a vessel to spread dyspathy and shadow beyond your realm.\u201d\n\nGenrene was confused for a moment. Why would a creature such as this explain its plan to its own mindless servant? Why bother with the monologue? Genrene\u2019s answer came quickly and shocked him to his core.\n\nThere, on closer inspection, he saw Cyrus struggle and writhe on the ground. All around him, the rust grew and consumed all. But not just simple rust born of water, no. Something dwelled there and darkness loomed over everything.\n\n\u201cDo you accept your place, my servant?\u201d the statue boomed.\n\n\u201cYeeeesss,\u201d Cyrus hissed through gritted teeth.\n\n\u201cGood. The god of gods created us to end the world many centuries ago, and still, humanity has held out. We were made in the likeness of a scourge to wipe out all of Pandora\u2019s children. And so we will.\u201d\n\nCyrus continued to writhe on the ground but Genrene remained still, not daring to give in to the hope that his most trusted friend still remained.\n\n\u201cI have one last task for you, my servant. End your captain in the trees. And do not let him stop the ship. Despite what he might try, I fear it is too late for him, but I must remain certain.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, the darkness left.\n\nRust still remained instilled deep into the ground. Perhaps Genrene was so caught up by the haunting spirit or that it knew of his presence, but he hadn\u2019t noticed when the land around him changed.\n\nThe island wasn't of dark forests and stone-peaked mountains anymore. When Genrene looked up from Cyrus\u2019 now prone form, he was left breathless at the visage of a ruined civilisation. Buildings rose high around him, coloured with the same rust as he\u2019d seen before. The green forest underbrush now gave way to cracked and uncared for roads. Rust flaked everything and everywhere.\n\n\u2018But how was this?\u2019 Genrene thought. \u2018Buildings made of metal rather than wood? Giant structures taller than should be possible?\u2019\n\n\"A Serious house on serious earth,\" he whispered. An old saying that meant nonsense.\n\nGenrene didn\u2019t look back from the mesmerising structures around him until he felt the trunk of his lone tree sway. Before he was given an opportunity to look down though, he stumbled and half slid half fell to the ground. He knew who had done it before he even saw him.\n\nCyrus stood over him, teeth bared and rusted needle-like blade pointed threateningly toward him. Genrene unsheathed his own cutlass and the dance of steel began.\n\nSilver met brown and flakes of both flew in all directions. Genrene\u2019s blade was heavier and less sharp but was also stronger. Even so, the first blow took him by surprise and he threw himself back as the point jabbed at his side.\n\nCyrus dove forward, allowing his blood lust to drive him into a reckless attack. Though Genrene wasn't expecting such a brutal attack, he managed to expertly dodge the blow by jumping aside and plunged his own blade into his first mate\u2019s back. The steel quivered there for a second and his friend tried to rise from the wound but could not.\n\nGenrene marvelled at his own luck before remembering that the man lying before him had taken on a group of men before this and had won.\n\nGenrene thought to win his friend back with words but his mouth dried up and his throat tightened. And so, call it cowardice if you must, but he raised the cutlass once more and dealt the final blow before charging off away from the cursed abandoned town.\n\nMerely moments later, an exhausted flustered Genrene stood on the beach. He doubled over and breathed heavily as his beloved ship, The Genre, sailed further away, now just a misty shadow.\n\n***\n\nWc: 800\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The first thing I noticed was that you have a great eye for detail. You did a great job of setting the scene and making the reader feel like they were there.

In particular, the part where the entity explains its plan to Cyrus. I felt like this could be more concise and to the point.\n\nFinally, I would suggest ending the story on a more positive note. Perhaps with Genrene vowing to stop the entity and save his friend."}
{"prompt": "The command had been issued. The room was suddenly quiet. Alan became aware of every breath he took. Each tick of the grandfather clock, a thunderclap. He looked across the table at his father, old and grey. He knew this was his destiny, but so soon? He tried to resist.\n\n\n\"I don't even have kids, Dad,\" Alan spoke. He stared at his old man's face, looking for a reaction. None came, so he continued. \"It wouldn't make sense for me to take on your role. How could Father Time not be a father? Can't it wait? Clarissa and I have been trying, actually\u2014for kids, I mean\u2014but still no luck. It just doesn't seem right. I don't think I'm ready yet.\"\n\n\nHe finished speaking, though he had a million other things to say. He knew it wouldn't have mattered. His father shook his head.\n\n\n\"I'm too old,\" his father said with the same stoic tone Alan had known since childhood. \"The burdens of time are too heavy now. I know you're nervous, but this is something you can't be ready for. You just have to jump in. Now take my hand.\"\n\n\nAlan wanted to run. He looked out the windows of the house, into the empty void where time and space didn't exist. It was to become his home. He did as he was told.\n\n\nHis father's hands were cold. Alan hated how bony they were. *This is going to happen to me*, he thought to himself, and frowned. In comparison, his own hands were substantial, full of life, and warm. Even more sad, he remembered when his dad's hands had been like that too. The price of being Father Time was costly.\n\n\n\"It's going to get better,\" his father said. Alan looked into his cold, blue eyes. \"At first it's hard, but it does get easier, trust me. Good luck, son. I know you'll make me proud.\"\n\n\nAlan almost let go of his father's hands. Not because he was scared of the future, but because he was shocked by the words. Not once in thirty years had his father said something like that. It was always an order, or a reprimanding. Even at Alan's wedding, his father had refused to say more than a handful of cheap remarks.\n\n\nAnd then, he disappeared. The man known as Father Time left existence. Or, better to say, he was reincarnated. A title passed down from father to son.\n\n\nThe silence was broken by a raging scream. The old wooden chair Alan was sitting on crashed sideways against the floor, propelled by Alan's writhing in pain. The floor was cold against his body. He squeezed his forehead, hoping to make the hurting stop, as the entirety of the universe became aware of him, and him aware of it. Every single moment, every memory, ever, entered his mind. His brain couldn't handle the flood of information and emotion. After he could scream no more, he passed out. The grandfather clock ticked away in silence once again.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nClarissa cried. \"You should be happy,\" she said to the husk of the man sitting across the table. \"We've been trying for so long. Finally I'm pregnant.\" She had hoped this would be the one thing to break Alan out of, what he called, 'temporal apathy', but it seemed it wasn't so. He was as emotionless as ever.\n\n\n\"I am happy,\" he said, without a smile, or a frown, or any change in facial expression really. \"How many times must I say it?\"\n\n\n\"You're not happy! Look at you! Couldn't you at least try to look happy? Fake a smile? Anything? Please.\"\n\n\nHis wife's cries had little effect on Alan. Ever since he had shouldered the weight of time, he had become emotionally shutoff. It was a natural response to feeling every emotion ever, all the time, all at once. The human body adapts.\n\n\n\"I'm sorry love, I really am,\" Alan said, trying his hardest to sound remorseful, but failing, \"you know it's hard for me.\" \n\n\nThe truth of it was that Alan already knew all about their child. He knew they'd name him Caleb, and that he'd like soccer, and that he'd get drunk for the first time at fifteen at a house party, and that he'd steal money from them, and that he'd marry at 18, divorce at 20, remarry the same girl at 22, and divorce for good at 26. He knew everything. And, just like Alan, his son would try to run from becoming Father Time, failing. With a sigh, he took his wife's hands in his and tried his best to console her. Just going through the motions seemed to be enough.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAlan was reading a book when Clarissa walked in. He looked up with the same expression he always had on. \n\n\n\"It's happening,\" she said. \"My water's broke.\"\n\n\nThey drove to the hospital, exchanging minimal words. After getting checked in and a bed, the two waited. Clarissa was in labor for 20 hours. Alan sat with her the entire time, even though it was just physically. It was the least, and most, he could do. Caleb Martin Time came in at a healthy weight of 7 pounds 4 ounces. He was unusually silent for a newborn, and after the doctor decided the baby was fine, he let the mother hold him. \n\n\n\"Look, dear,\" she said to Alan, \"he has your eyes. Beautiful and blue.\" \n\n\nAlan looked at his son, feeling like he'd already done it all before. Everything in him was just a whirlwind of memories. Clarissa held the baby out. Alan tilted his head to the side.\n\n\n\"Don't you want to hold your son?\" she asked.\n\n\n\"Oh, right,\" Alan said, as he took the baby into his arms.\n\n\nEverything began to slow down.\n\n\nFor the first time in forever, Alan was present there, in that moment. The tornado of time he was always stuck inside paused. He looked down at the baby, *his* baby, in his arms. Clarissa couldn't help but smile as she saw something she hadn't in a long time. A tear rolled down Alan's cheek as the temporal apathy melted away. He put on a smile, not the one he used to have, back before he had shouldered the burdens of time, but one that was new, and trying, and promised to grow with each passing second. Clarissa looked up at her husband, and, by the expression on his face, she knew he was returning. Not fully back yet, no, but on the train home. She didn't know how long it would take for him to fully arrive, but she promised to the three of them that she'd be there, waiting at the station. \n\n\n\"Hi, little guy,\" Alan said, testing out his new smile, brushing his baby's thin hair, and wishing his own father was there to see it all.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The command had been issued.
